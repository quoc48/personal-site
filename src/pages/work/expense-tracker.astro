          <p>
            For more than two years, I used Notion (and a few other apps) to track my daily expenses. It worked, but barely. Every time I wanted to log something, I had to open the app, navigate to the right database, create a new entry, fill in multiple fields... you get the idea. Too many steps for something I do several times a day.
          </p>

          <p>
            The other apps I tried were either too complex or too rigid. None of them felt quite right for how I wanted to see my spending patterns. So I thought: why not build exactly what I need?

          <h2 class="font-bold">The MVP Features</h2>
          <p>
            I started simple. The first version focuses on just a few things that matter most to me:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 pl-1">
            <li><span class="font-medium">Monthly Report:</span> A clear overview of where my money goes each month.</li>
            <li><span class="font-medium">Camera Scanning:</span> Add or edit expenses by simply snapping a photo of a receipt—AI handles the rest.</li>
            <li><span class="font-medium">Recurring Expenses:</span> Set it once for bills and subscriptions, forget about manual entry.</li>
            <li><span class="font-medium">Light/Dark Mode</span></li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="font-lato font-normal text-base md:text-[18px] text-[#2c2c2c] leading-[1.5] space-y-4">
          <h2 class="font-bold">A Simple Tech Stack</h2>
          <p>
            I kept the technology deliberately simple:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 pl-1">
            <li><span class="font-medium">Flutter:</span> Cross-platform framework so I can use it on both iOS and Android.</li>
            <li><span class="font-medium">Supabase:</span> Backend and database—easy to set up, generous free tier.</li>
            <li><span class="font-medium">OpenAI API:</span> Powers the receipt scanning and data extraction.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Nothing fancy. Just tools that let me move fast and focus on the experience rather than infrastructure.
          </p>

          <h2 class="font-bold">Design First, Then Code</h2>
          <p>
            My process was straightforward: design everything in Figma first, then implement. What made it interesting was connecting Figma directly to Claude Code through MCP (Model Context Protocol). This let me reference my designs while coding, and the results matched my mockups almost perfectly.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's a workflow I'm really enjoying—thinking through the UX visually before writing any code, then having an AI assistant that understands both what I designed and what I'm trying to build.
          </p>

          <h2 class="font-bold">What's Next</h2>
          <p>
            There's still a lot I want to add: advanced reports with better visualizations, voice input for quick logging, maybe some smart insights about spending habits. The beauty of building your own tool is that you can shape it exactly how you want, at your own pace.
